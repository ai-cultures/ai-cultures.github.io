# Cultures in AI/AI in Culture
## NeurIPS 2022 Workshop

# Description

We are accepting submissions for the virtual NeurIPS 2022 Workshop on Cultures of AI and AI for Culture to be held on **December 9**. This is a cross-disciplinary workshop with experts in AI/ML and social sciences discussing how AI influences culture and how culture influences AI.  More details at our workshop website: https://ai-cultures.github.io/

## Call for position papers

We are looking for 2-3 page position papers that center a provocation on how cultures shape AI design and development or how AI tools shape cultural consumption/production. These provocations can be theoretical, methodological, technical, exploratory or empirical. This workshop is meant to be inter-disciplinary so we welcome submissions of social AND technical papers from scholars of diverse theoretical backgrounds including but not limited to Machine Learning, Computer Science, Anthropology, Sociology, Human-Computer Interaction, and Media Studies.  Please make sure your papers are understandable to a broad, cross-disciplinary audience. These submissions are non-archival, will not be part of published proceedings or considered a refereed publication.

Themes include but are not limited to:

1. Dominant cultures that shape broader AI solutions
2. Cultural assumptions encoded in design decisions of tools like text-to-image models, music production technologies, recommender systems, and language technologies   
3. Performance of AI technologies in various cultural contexts (e.g. translation systems) 
4. Harms of deploying culturally inappropriate AI systems in different global cultural contexts
5. Disciplinary assumptions that influence technical aspects of machine learning research  
6. Impact on artists and communities as they use AI for generation, production, and distribution of cultural content
7. Current or expected changes in macro-level cultural trends due to AI

We welcome papers focusing on the relationship between culture and social and technical aspects of AI design and development including but not limited to: 

1. Datasets and training corpora
2. Problem formulation
3. Imagination of solutions
4. Optimization objectives
5. Evaluation metrics
6. Research and deployment organization
7. Other design decisions (e.g. hardware, model parameters)

We take an expansive definition of culture including but not limited to:

1. Socio-cultural and geographical context
2. Pedagogical/disciplinary cultures  
3. Institutional cultures
4. Creative culture
5. Religion
6. Broader tech ecosystem

## Reviewing

Papers will be reviewed by workshop organizers and selected for:
- Disciplinary depth 
- Novelty of perspectives
- Ability to foster cross-disciplinary dialog

## Presentation Format

Accepted submissions will be non-archival and presented during the workshop as short lightning presentations.
